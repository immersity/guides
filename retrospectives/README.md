Retrospective
=============

A guide about doing retrospectives.

General
-------

* Do them periodically.
* Prefer doing them after weekly iterations. Letting too much time pass may make the retrospective
  too disperse.
* Schedule for one hour. The first retrospectives may take half an hour more.
* Don't be afraid of wrapping things up if it extends too much.
* Use the following schedule:
  * Prime Directive
  * Brainstorming (30 minutes)
  * Mute Mapping (10 minutes)
  * Retrospective Objective (20 minutes)
* Evaluate modifying the schedule after some retrospectives.

Prime Directive
---------------

* Facilitators should defuse any destructive behaviour.
* Remember everyone that we all make mistakes and this is an instance to learn and improve.
* Write Norm Kerth’s Prime Directive on the board:
  * Regardless of what we discover today, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best
    job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources
    available, and the situation at hand.
* Ask each attendee if he agrees and wait for a verbal “yes”. Speaking once will make it more likely
  to speak again.

Brainstorming
-------------
* Write the following headings on the whiteboard:
  * Enjoyable
  * Frustrating
  * Puzzling
  * Same
  * More
  * Less
* Hand out post it notes and pencils.
* Encourage the team to write ideas under these headings and one idea per card.
* Ask people to read out their idea before handing it over and putting it on the whiteboard.
* Ideas may be out of the team’s control.
* As many ideas as they want, typically five to ten.
* Anything is valid, from “more cookies” to “impossible deadlines”.
* Don’t group ideas yet, only put them under their headings.
* Discussion about the ideas is ok, it can lead to new ideas.
* Let the silences stretch as someone can say something he’s been holding up.

Mute Mapping
------------

* Invite everyone to stand up and go over to the whiteboard.
* There are three rules:
  * Put related cards close together.
  * Put unrelated cards far apart.
  * No talking.
* If two people disagree, they have to work out a compromise without talking.
* Once mute mapping is complete, there should be clear groups of cards.
* Ask everyone to sit down.
* Draw circles around each group of cards and outlier cards.
* Read some cards of each group and ask the team to name the category. Don’t try to find the perfect
  name.
* Give 5 votes to each person to distribute amongst the categories he wishes to improve. He may put
  all the votes on one category.

Retrospective Objective
-----------------------

* After voting, one category should be the winner or flip a coin to choose one.
* Discard the cards from the other categories.
* Read the cards in the category.
* Brainstorm ideas on how to improve the category using root-cause analysis.
* Don’t be too detailed on ideas, a general direction is enough.
* Once we have several ideas, ask the group which one is the best, or vote.
* The final vote is the retrospective objective. It must be only one.
* That objective will be the focus until the next retrospective.
* Ask the team how to track the objective.
* Assign one person responsible on working out the details.
* Assign one person responsible of reminding everyone when appropriate.
